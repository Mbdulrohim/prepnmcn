# PREPNMCN.COM Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of PREPNMCN.COM features. Check off completed items as we progress.

**Current Status (October 2025):**

- âœ… **Admin Exam Management**: Complete CRUD system with pricing, multi-currency support, and exam types
- âœ… **Question Management**: Complete admin interface with bulk upload, CRUD operations, and exam linking
- âœ… **Student Exam Enrollment System**: Full enrollment flow with payment integration and dashboard tracking
- ðŸ”„ **Next Priority**: Exam Taking Interface (students need to actually take the exams they've enrolled in)
